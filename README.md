# pyflow-wellies

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> This software is **Incubating** and subject to ECMWF's guidelines on [Software Maturity](https://github.com/ecmwf/codex/raw/refs/heads/main/Project%20Maturity).

Wellies provides extra features to help you build consistent and configurable
pyflow suites. This guide assumes a good level of familiarity with
[ecflow](https://ecflow.readthedocs.io) suites and using
[pyflow](http://pyflow-workflow-generator.readthedocs.io) for its design and
generation. Please refer to these projects' documentantion if some point about
them is not clear.

# Features

- ***YAML*-based configuration** for your suites: wellies provides simple
patterns to help configuring your suite, making them more flexible and suitable for
different use cases and environments.
- Simple template to start your **suite design from scratch**: Don't get blocked
by a blanck page; with `wellies-quickstart` starting to code a new workflow is
one command away.
- **Git-tracked suite deployment** from [tracksuite](https://github.com/ecmwf/tracksuite): Wellies comes fully integrated with tracksuite providing git-based changes control for multi-users and remote deployment environments.
- **Extended *pyflow* nodes** for improved suite design, configuration and monitoring.
- **Template scripts** for improved reproducibility and support to D-R-Y design when it comes to scripting, like when dealing with datetime objects, *MARS* requests and others.

# Quick Start

To create an empty suite with the default wellies structure, simply run

```
wellies-quickstart /path/to/project -p mysuite
```

Once created the suite can be build with:

```
cd /path/to/project
./mysuite.py configs/*.yaml
```

which is equivalent to

```
./mysuite.py configs/config.yaml config/tools.yaml configs/data.yaml config/execution_contexts.yaml
```

You can also cherry pick your configuration files following your needs:

```
cd /path/to/project
./mysuite.py configs/config.yaml config/tools.yaml
```

Alternatively you use named preset groups of configurations defined in a default `Makefile` and just use

```
make
```

# Installation

First you need to assure you have [ecFlow](https://ecflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed on your system.
The simplest way is to create a conda environment. We recommend using
[mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to speed up the environment creation process:

```
mamba create -c conda-forge -n wellies-env python=3.10 ecflow
conda activate wellies-env
```

Install from the Github repository directly:
```
python -m pip install https://github.com/ecmwf/pyflow-wellies
```
or from PyPI:
```
python -m pip install pyflow-wellies
```

# Contributing

First build a development conda environment

```
mamba env create -f ./environment.yml -n wellies-env
conda activate wellies-env
```

Then install with development dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/ecmwf/pyflow-wellies.git
cd pyflow-wellies
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Building package

To build source distributions, [build](https://build.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html) is required.
With that the source distribution can be built from any environment with

```
git clone https://github.com/ecmwf/pyflow-wellies.git
cd pyflow-wellies
python -m build
```

## Testing

To run tests, first install testing dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/ecmwf/pyflow-wellies.git
cd pyflow-wellies
pip install .[test]
```

Then to run all tests
```
python -m pytest
```

## Documentation

To build your own local documentation you need [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and a few
entra plugins. As there are many auto-generated parts in the documentation,
you will need a environment with wellies and all of its dependencies installed to build the documentation.
To install the documentation-only dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/ecmwf/pyflow-wellies.git
    cd pyflow-wellies
    pip install .[docs]

Then to build it

    mkdocs build

To build and make it available in a local server

    mkdocs serve
